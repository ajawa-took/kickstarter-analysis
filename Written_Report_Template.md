# Kickstarting with Excel



## Overview of Project


 We looked at the data from past theater kickstarters.


### Purpose

 To identify factors, such as launch date or fundraising goal, that predict the success of the kickstarter.



## Analysis and Challenges



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date





### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered



## Results



### Launch your theater kickstarter in May!

 Many more theater kickstarters are launched in spring and summer than in fall and winter. The number of failed projects just barely show this trend, but the number of successful projects doubles from winter to early summer. May appears to be the best month to launch a theater kickstarter, with two thirds of the projects succeeding; while December is the worst, with only half the projects funded.


### Theater kickstarters for plays with smaller goals are more successfull

 Among kickstarters with goals under $25,000, smaller campaigns were clearly more successful. At the high end of that range, only about half of the projects were funded; but at the low end, nearly three-quarters were funded.

  The wild swings in the right half of the graph are the result of very sparse data. Many of those goal ranges contain less than 10 projects. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that barely over a quarter of these 42 large (goal over $25,000) projects were funded, maintaining the trend found among smaller projects.

### Concerns

 This dataset is very outdated: the latest project launch date is in March 2017. Kickstarter is a quite a recent thing, so it is likely to have changed a lot. The theater world has also changed hugely in the last two years.



### Further directions

 Length of campaign and number of backers are two other interesting factors to investigate.
